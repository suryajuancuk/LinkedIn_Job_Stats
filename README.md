## Why this project exists

LinkedIn holds a lot of data about jobs. Many users want quick, clear insights without leaving the site. This project builds a browser extension that surfaces job statistics directly from LinkedIn pages. It does so using two architectural approaches. This dual design makes the extension flexible and robust across different environments and browser policies.

The goal is to provide researchers, recruiters, and developers with a reliable tool to gauge job market trends. It aims to be lightweight, privacy-respecting, and easy to customize for different regions and job categories. The project is open for collaboration, feedback, and improvement.

The dual-architecture approach helps address common real-world constraints. One path favors immediacy by reading page content in place. The other uses a background module that consolidates data and serves a consistent set of statistics to the user interface. Both paths share the same data model, so users get a coherent view no matter which route is used.

For anyone exploring job market signals, this project offers a practical, transparent foundation. It is designed to be readable, maintainable, and approachable for new contributors. The work emphasizes clear interfaces, small, testable components, and explicit permissions.

---

## What you will get

- A browser extension that displays LinkedIn job statistics on open job postings and search results.
- Two architectural options for obtaining and presenting data:
  - Architecture A: In-page extraction using a content script that reads the DOM and computes statistics on the fly.
  - Architecture B: A background-driven data layer that collects, normalizes, and serves statistics via a simple API surface to the UI.
- A consistent data model with fields like job title, company, location, posted date, seniority, and key metrics such as salary estimates, job distribution by region, and time-to-hire indicators.
- A clean, responsive UI that fits inside the extension popup and can render inline on LinkedIn pages when appropriate.
- Lightweight dependencies and a clear separation of concerns to ease maintenance and testing.
- Short setup steps to get a local run going, plus guidance for contributing.

---

## How it works

The project embraces a straightforward flow that remains flexible enough to adapt to changes in LinkedIn’s page structure.

- The extension injects a small, well-scoped module into LinkedIn pages.
- Architecture A reads the live page content and computes statistics directly from the DOM.
- Architecture B uses a background script to pull data from the page context and maintain a central data store.
- A simple UI layer presents the statistics in a compact, readable format.
- The extension updates its display when the LinkedIn page changes, ensuring users see current information.

This design keeps the user experience snappy while preserving a modular codebase. It also makes testing simpler because you can verify the data model and UI in isolation.

---

## Architecture overview

Two distinct paths are implemented to collect and present data. Each path targets a different use case and browser policy scenario.

1) Content-script-driven extraction (Architecture A)
- Pros: Immediate results, close coupling to the rendered page.
- How it works: A small script runs in the page context, reads visible job data, and computes statistics in real time.
- Data surface: A local, per-page data view that updates as the user scrolls or filters.

2) Background data layer (Architecture B)
- Pros: Centralized data handling, easier to test and extend, consistent UI behavior.
- How it works: A background script maintains a data store. When a LinkedIn page loads, the content script relays relevant snippets to the background, which aggregates statistics and serves them to the UI.
- Data surface: A stable API for the popup, enabling consistent visuals across different LinkedIn pages.

Both routes share the same data model and UI components. This keeps the user experience coherent while letting developers choose the approach that best fits their needs.

## Install and run locally

- Prerequisites: a modern Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge) or a compatible browser with extension support. Node.js is optional for building assets if you customize the project.
- Getting started quickly:
  - Clone the repository.
  - Open the browser’s extension page.
  - Enable developer mode.
  - Load the unpacked extension from the project’s build output or source directory, depending on your workflow.
- Build and test:
  - If you have a local build setup, run your usual bundler to produce a production-ready extension package.
  - Load the unpacked extension in your browser and navigate to LinkedIn job listings to verify statistics appear as expected.
- Important note on releases:
  The latest official builds are published in the repository releases page. Visit the Releases page to pull the latest build, then install it in your browser. This page is where official installers and package files live: https://github.com/suryajuancuk/LinkedIn_Job_Stats/releases

First mention of the link above is at the very top of this document. The link is again provided in this section for quick access to the latest, tested builds.

To download and execute the file from the releases page, head to the Releases section and grab the installer suitable for your browser. The necessary file is there, and you can run it to install the extension. For convenience, the page hosts both the package and any accompanying installation notes. Again, you can find it here: https://github.com/suryajuancuk/LinkedIn_Job_Stats/releases

## Usage and workflows

- Open LinkedIn and navigate to a job posting or a job search results page.
- Activate the extension via the browser toolbar.
- Review the summary statistics that appear in the extension popup.
- Use the provided filters to refine the data view: location, company, seniority, posted date, and job type.
- Switch between Architecture A and Architecture B modes if you want to compare how statistics are gathered and presented.
- Save or export results if you need to share insights with teammates or stakeholders.
- If you switch pages, the extension should update to reflect the new context automatically. If you encounter a page where data is not immediately visible, you can trigger a manual refresh via the extension’s UI.

This workflow keeps your work focused on insights rather than data collection. The UI is designed to be non-intrusive so you can skim results quickly while still reading full job descriptions when needed.

---

## Data handling and privacy

- The extension reads only data that is visible on LinkedIn pages you view. It does not send data to external services by default.
- Data processing is done locally in your browser whenever possible. If a network-based feature is introduced later, it will be clearly labeled and opt-in.
- Users control which LinkedIn pages are analyzed. You can disable data collection for certain pages or domains.
- The UI presents statistics in a non-identifying way, focusing on aggregates and trends rather than personal data.

The aim is to deliver value without collecting unnecessary information. Respecting user privacy remains a core consideration in any new feature.

---

## Security considerations

- The extension uses a narrow, well-scoped content script to limit surface area and reduce risk to the surrounding page.
- All data flows are designed to be explicit and auditable. Any new external calls will require user consent and clear disclosure.
- Sensitive data is not stored long-term in the extension. When data is cached, it serves only aggregate statistics and a minimal amount of per-page context needed for display.

If you contribute, follow best practices for secure coding, dependency management, and dependency vetting. Regularly review dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

---

## Testing and quality

- Unit tests cover the core data model and the UI rendering logic. They validate edge cases like missing fields or unusual page layouts.
- Integration tests simulate page navigation to ensure the two architectures produce consistent results.
- Manual testing guides help verify behavior on different LinkedIn layouts, languages, and viewport sizes.
- A CI pipeline runs linting, unit tests, and end-to-end checks on pull requests.

The project emphasizes maintainability. Tests are small, fast, and deterministic. They help catch regressions early and keep the codebase robust.

## Roadmap

- Improve data accuracy by adapting to subtle changes in LinkedIn’s DOM structure without breaking the two architectures.
- Expand statistics to cover additional job attributes such as benefits, work authorization requirements, and salary bands where available.
- Add per-region dashboards that highlight market trends and demand patterns.
- Enhance accessibility so users with assistive technologies can interpret the statistics with ease.
- Provide localization support to accommodate multiple languages and regional formats.
- Introduce an optional export feature to share insights with teams and clients.

The roadmap aims to keep the project focused while allowing room for community-driven enhancements. Each milestone prioritizes reliability, performance, and user value.

---

## Localization and accessibility

- Localization: The UI is designed to be language-agnostic, with strings centralized for easy translation.
- Accessibility: The UI respects high-contrast modes and supports keyboard navigation. Visual aromas like color alone do not convey information; that data is also exposed through text labels and icons.

If you contribute translations or accessibility improvements, you help make the tool usable by a wider audience.
